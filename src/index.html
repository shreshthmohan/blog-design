            <section>
              <p>
                I was nearing the last working days of the job that I recently
                quit, I thought whether I should leave Bangalore. It was a good
                idea to start reducing the amount of stuff I owned if I planned
                to leave. I wasn't very sure though. It made sense to downsize
                anyway.
              </p>

              <p>
                So, I started taking photos of things I wouldn't need and put
                them up on OLX. I knew I had a lot of junk, but when I started
                digging stuff out of boxes lying around I realized it was more
                than I had thought. I had two football pumps for instance!
                Badminton and squash rackets I hadn't used in more than a year.
                As I had been more focused on outdoor activities like hiking and
                cycling, I didn't think twice about letting go of stuff I hadn't
                used in a while.
              </p>

              <h2 class="" id="limits">Limits!</h2>

              <p>
                Once a few products sold, I got more confident about selling
                more, but then came an unexpected revelation. OLX has limits on
                how many ads one can put up for each category, and one has to
                wait up to 60 days or pay up to post more ads.
              </p>

              <p>
                This was a major roadblock because I wanted to get rid of all
                the unused stuff in one go. That's because selling used stuff is
                distracting and time-consuming. It's like an unpredictable day
                job. Buyers might message or call you unexpectedly, ask a bunch
                of questions and eventually never turn up to make the deal. You
                can't really focus on other work if you're selling more than a
                few items.
              </p>

              <h2 id="a-new-find">A new find!</h2>

              <p>
                So while I was exploring alternatives to Olx, I stumbled upon
                Facebook Marketplace! I haven't been actively using Facebook for
                the last few years and didn't plan to change that. But Facebook
                Marketplace is an amazing piece of software, especially for
                selling used products.
              </p>

              <p>Facebook Marketplace is better because,</p>

              <ol>
                <li>There are no limits to how many products you can list.</li>
                <li>The pool of potential buyers is bigger</li>
                <li>
                  Your communications with sellers are better organized, you can
                  see all your conversations grouped by each item.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                And of course, no product is perfect, Facebook Marketplace has a
                few downsides too.
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  You might find people making unreasonable requests. People
                  asked me to ship to another city and expected cash on
                  delivery, for an item I was selling for ‚Çπ200. The cheapest
                  courier service would cost at least the same amount. This
                  never happened on OLX.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I feel that there are more non-serious buyers on FB because
                  people go to OLX with a clear intent of buying.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Facebook can be very distracting. I don't particularly enjoy
                  using Facebook, and because it's all in one place and it's
                  easy to get distracted on Facebook
                </li>
                <li>
                  People might ridicule you for selling low-value items. I
                  either ignore such people or tell them, ‚Äúeverything sells.‚Äù üòä
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                If you have a lot of items to sell, say more than 10, try to
                list on both Facebook Marketplace as well as OLX. Prefer OLX if
                you are selling fewer and high-value items.
              </p>

              <p>
                Great, I had a new place to sell which doesn't have a limit on
                listing count. But what I thought would be a few days of work,
                became a shitty day job. So I tried selling faster.
              </p>

              <h2 id="selling-faster">Selling Faster</h2>

              <p>
                I figured out that people bought a product very quickly if you
                offered them door delivery. Humans are lazy. Some deliveries
                were made by me on my bicycle or on a two-wheeler on my way to a
                friend's place and some via apps like Dunzo or Porter. All
                except one delivery went smoothly.
              </p>

              <p>
                Another strategy that works well is pitting buyers against each
                other by just letting them know that you have another buyer
                making an offer. This is especially useful when some buyers
                become inactive after making an offer.
              </p>

              <p>
                I am not proud to be mentioning this, but I lied to some
                inactive buyers by asking them if they were still interested and
                I was checking with them before I made a deal with another buyer
                because they were the first ones to reach out. I did this to
                sell a product that had seen some activity but no buyer actually
                took the final step.
              </p>

              <p>
                Things sell faster if you have all the accessories, the original
                packaging, and the invoice. So don't throw away the packaging
                and invoice when you buy a used or a new item. It also helps if
                your item belongs to a well-known brand. It's also a good idea
                to add product details, search the product on Amazon and Google
                to find out the details of the product. For instance, I sold a
                Dell laptop adapter and it helped to figure out which laptops
                that charger was compatible with.
              </p>

              <h2 id="negotiation">Negotiation</h2>

              <p>
                While taking good photos, writing a concise description, and
                setting an expected price are almost necessary to make a sale,
                negotiation is what you will spend most of your time on. So I
                think it's important to negotiate fast and well.
              </p>

              <p>Here are some tactics I employed.</p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Don't reveal your ‚Äúlast‚Äù price, unless you're in a hurry and
                  you think the buyer is not a haggler. You've already mentioned
                  a price in the listing, so if a buyer asks you for a price
                  just repeat that. If they still insist, ask them to make an
                  offer. Once they choose a number they can't go below that
                  price.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In some cases, if a buyer is in a hurry they will easily agree
                  to your price. Give them a number and don't respond for some
                  time if they keep low-balling. Some buyers might automatically
                  increase their offers. In one case a buyer agreed to my price
                  within a few minutes of silence from my side.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some buyers will point out flaws or missing accessories for
                  your item. It's pretty easy to say that you would have listed
                  at a higher price if your item didn't have those flaws.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <h2 id="everything-sells">Everything sells</h2>

              <p>
                Well almost. As I sold more and more stuff I thought of trying
                to sell stuff that I didn't even think could even sell. More for
                the experimentation than the money. USB charging adapters, for
                instance. I think they are all the same except in terms of
                wattage. But not everyone thinks like me. An original 5W Apple
                iPod USB adapter is probably more valuable on the market than a
                20W fast charger one from almost any other brand. I sold one for
                ‚Çπ500! One the other hand got laughed at for even thinking of
                listing a Xiaomi USB adapter.
              </p>

              <h2 id="scams-and-surprises">Scams and Surprises</h2>

              <p>
                Selling online comes with its own risks, especially in India.
                The most common scam I encountered was people accepting your
                listed price and agreeing to pay advance. What they do is send
                you a QR code which is actually a payment request and make it
                seem like a request which will credit money to your account. And
                usually, these people respond very quickly and almost never
                negotiate.
              </p>

              <p>
                Amidst all of this, I was surprised when a buyer actually paid
                money in advance. I was so surprised and skeptical that I asked
                him how he trusted me and sent the money before actually getting
                the items. I could have refused to send him the products and
                blocked his number. Of course, I didn't. And the sale happened
                smoothly except for a botch-up by the delivery truck driver who
                extracted money from both of us. I later got the issue resolved
                by the delivery service provider, namely Porter.
              </p>

              <p>
                I also managed to sell an item to a buyer in another city. I
                asked a friend who has an online store if I could use her
                delivery partner to ship the item. She graciously agreed and it
                was only ‚Çπ155 to ship a 1kg package from Bangalore to Kochi. And
                the package was picked up from my doorstep. I later found out
                that one doesn't need to have a business account to use
                Delhivery Direct's service. Neat, eh?
              </p>

              <h2 id="taking-a-step-back">Taking a step back</h2>

              <p>
                In conclusion, selling your old junk on OLX and Facebook
                Marketplace is a great way to declutter and generate some extra
                cash. But it can take over your life and become akin to a day
                job. I have sold 24 items so far and still have 15 unsold items
                listed, but I have disabled notifications for both OLX and
                Facebook Marketplace and I check notifications only once a day
                or so to keep my sanity.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you are curious about what I sold and for how much, I am
                attaching a table here for your reference. By the way, I lied!
                ‚Çπ14,000 out of the total ‚Çπ30,000 I got by selling old junk went
                to my friends whose items I sold on their behalf.
